## Introduction

### Purpose

 This project is useful for those interested in Unreal Engine (UE) and don't know where to start or have never used blueprints in UE before.

 Blueprints in UE are the bread and butter for putting together amazing games with little-to-no programming knowledge. This guide is built to take someone by the hand, step-by-step, and even address common technical issues that may come up along the way.

## Tools and compatibility

This tutorial guide will be based on Unreal Engine 5.5.4 and Visual Studio (VS) 2022, though, you will have the option to choose an earlier version of UE and a different IDE other than VS.

We will use these tools to complete the tutorial guide:

- Epic Games Launcher
- Unreal Engine
- VS or an alternative IDE if needed (i.e. Visual Studio Code or for macOS you can use XCode)
- Search engine such as Google (and Youtube)

    *Note: VS is no longer supported on macOS and you should refer to macOS focused guides for proper context. Use [this guide for alternatives to Visual Studio](https://github.com/botman99/ue4-xcode-vscode-mac)*

## Ready to get started?

Use this guide to [get Unreal Engine installed onto your computer.](ue_install_guide.md) This is inclusive for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Then head to [the blueprint guide](blueprint_guide.md) to make your first blueprint!
